# Ludum Dare Survival Guide

> "It's dangerous to go alone! Read this."

Ludum Dare, the largest game jam on the planet, possibly in existence, should not be taken lightly. During this event, thousands of game developers from across the world congregate to attempt the unthinkable: build a game in less than 48 hours (or 72 hours for compo participators).

The rules are simple, but execution is not. Ludum Dare has rebuffed countless developers attempting to answer its challenge. Many of these developers likely could have reached their goal if only they knew this: a successful Ludum Dare submission involves more than what meets the eye.

> Ludum Dare can be taken however you want, but if you want to push yourself and craft the best submission possible, you'll need this guide to help you out.

> Below are tips for all ludum dare challengers, both newbies and veterans can pick up a tip or two here.

# Part 1: Preparation

> Treat the lead up to Ludum Dare how you would treat an important exam and set yourself up for success

## 1.1 Adopt the mindset

Before preparing for Ludum Dare, you need to make sure that you're preparing with the right goal in mind. Get into the Ludum Dare mindset: "I am going to __FINISH__ a game this weekend". You are not going to just make a game, you are going to __FINISH__ a game __this weekend__.

Keeping this goal in mind will help you when deciding on what content to create, how to budget your time, and which tools to use.

When you focus on finishing you will gravitate towards making decisions that push your project towards completion. That means fighting back against feature creep, sticking to a realistic scope, living with mistakes, and seizing every opportunity.

Anyone can make a game if they invest enough time into it, but only so few can make a game on such an extreme timeline and even fewer can make it _good_.

So if you want to succeed: get into the mindset of finishing, that is the most important part of conquering Ludum Dare.

> Tip: KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid), if you want to __FINISH__ then you have to keep it simple.

> Note: Here's an article by Derek Yu (creator of Spelunky) on [Finishing a Game](https://makegames.tumblr.com/post/1136623767/finishing-a-game). Many of these tips apply to Ludum Dare.

## 1.2 Schedule your time

Take a look at that 48-hour block and figure out how much time you'll need for each task. You'll have a lot of tasks to complete, including: designing, developing, polishing, debugging, submission, sleeping. Write it down on a piece of paper and keep it nearby.

Here's an example of what this might look like:

| schedule | task | hours
| - | :---: | - 
| 00 - 02 | upfront design | 2 
| 02 - 16 | develop | 14
| 16 - 22 | sleep | 6 
| 22 - 26 | develop | 4 
| 26 - 35 | polish | 9 
| 35 - 40 | debug | 5 
| 40 - 44 | sleep | 4 
| 44 - 48 | publish & submit | 4

This is one way to divide your time but you should tweak this to fit your specific needs; maybe you need to allocate time for art, or music, or UI, whatever the case, factor in what you see fit.

> Tip: Set milestones for yourself to preview feature creep, for example: _"after Hour 24 I will not add any new features"_.  

## 1.3 Assemble your tools

Decide what tools you will be using for Ludum Dare. Will you be using Unity or something simpler like Game Maker. It doesn't matter what tools you pick as long as you are __comfortable__ using them. Ensure that all your development tools are running, by starting them each, one-by-one, to make sure that none of the installs are corrupted. 

Once you have all your tools installed and operational: make sure that you have the correct development libraries for these tools. Depending on your set-up this may mean installing additional requirements for things like "exporting your project", you __definitently__ don't want to be looking for an exporter during Submssion Hour.

Additionally you should sign up for whatever distribution channel you will be usings: itch.io, Newgrounds, Dropbox, etc.

#### New tools?

Although some developers use Ludum as an opportunity to try new tools, for the majority of this is a bad idea. Once again, the goal of Ludum Dare is to __finish__ a game, and that's much harder to do if you spend spend the first hours writing "Hello World."

If you're set on using new/unfamiliar tools then get acquanted with them before Ludum Dare starts. 

#### Teams

> I don't have many notes on teams because I haven't collaborated for Ludum Dare before

If you’re working on a team this is the time to assemble your team members. Make sure you are all on the same page with the same versions of software, collaborative tools, and designated roles.

> itch.io has an [article on Ludum Dare](https://itch.io/blog/178/get-ready-for-ludum-dare) that contains some information specifically on submitting to the platform


## 1.4 Plan additional content

Many developers that attempt Ludum like to document the process. This is a great way to drum up some attention for your project or your brand. 

Here are some of the popular options:

- Post mortem: Create a post mortem is a great way to investigate which tactics worked during Ludum Dare and which didn't.

- Timelapse Video: creating a video to show the entire development process. 

	> Tip, remember to [Assemble Your Tools](#1.1-assemble-your-tools). Download a timelapse creator and configure it beforehand.

- Stream: many devs like to stream their Ludum Dare development. There are even ludum-dare tags on twitch. 
	
	> Note: be careful with this one, streaming can get distracting, especially when you interact with your audience.

- Social media: Twitter buzzing during Ludum Dare with countless devs sharing their progress ([I'll be one of them](http://twitter.com/shelsoloa)). In general social media is a great way to share your Ludum Dare with others in the scene.

Doing additional content is a bonus way of getting more out of your Ludum Dare, the method itself isn't important, just be sure to strategize so it won't get in the way of your main goal: finishing.

## 1.5 Stock up

You may have a chance to take a break and run to the store during Ludum, or the thought of leaving your workstation will give you heart palpitations, in either case, it's best to be prepared so that you won't HAVE to leave if you're not in an optimal position to do so.

Here's a list of things to stock up on before the event:

- Groceries

  First for a reason: don't neglect your human needs; Ludum Dare is fun but it's seriously not worth jeopardizing your long-term health.  Make sure to eat.

  I say groceries because going out to eat is really not in the option if you're trying to maintain an efficient schedule.

  What foods should you eat? Look for foods that require little/no preparation but have some nutritional value (junk food could cause you to crash), or meal prep it beforehand

  > Tip: Energy drinks can provide that much needed burst of energy during late hours but don't overdo it!

- Pen & Paper ~ if you do any form of hand-drawn/handwritten design then make sure you're stocked on paper and writing utensils. I

  > Tip: Try doing your first design draft on paper __before__ you move on to programming and committing to anything

- Camera/Scanner ~ for capturing design done on paper. Not really necessary during the compo if you plan on posting afterwards, but if you want to post during the event this is an additional measure to consider.

## 1.6 Get into form

In the days leading up to Ludum to get more rest than usual. You'll be on a tight schedule and rest can really disrupt a good flow, so get plenty of sleep beforehand, that way you can remain "fresh" for as long as possible.

Additionally, get some exercise in, exercise will help promote a clear mind. A definite bonus when making quick decisions and solving bugs under pressure.

In short: be healthy and prepare for stress.

# Part 2 ~ Execution (During the Jam)

## 2.1 "Drink Water"

Take care of yourself. Ludum is a marathon and you'll need to be on your game if you want to reap the best benefits from this weekend.

- Sleep
 
  You probably don't want to sleep for 12 hours but the truth is that you will need to sleep at some point. During a 48-hour period most people sleep for an average of 12-16 hours.

  > Tip: if you've already finished your deep-work tasks then you can shorten your second sleep. You don't need to be "sharp" to tweak, build, and submit.

- Hygiene

  Mental health is impacted by the environment you keep, if your environment is dirty and crowded chances are your mind will be to. Keeping your environment (that includes both mind and body) physically clean will improve your performance, not to mention __YOUR PHYSICAL WELL BEING!__

  Many people decide to _“forgo”_ cleanliness during Ludum Dare because they view it as an unnecessary luxury, __DON'T__ be one of these people.

  > Tip: a few days before Ludum Dare give your entire workstation a deep clean.


## 2.2 Follow the plan

Remember that [Schedule](#) you made, well this is where you put it into effect.

If you told yourself that 4 hours was enough design then you should stick to it. Ludum Dare is about finishing and that is where the real challenge lies, so focus on sticking to the schedule.

The only time you should be deviating from the schedule is when you are comfortably ahead of time, and even then, do so with great caution.

> Tip:

## 2.3 Don't start over

After a certain amount of hours, you have to commit. Even if you think of a great new idea at Hour 20 you have to file it away because making a decent submission in 28 hours is far harder than making it in 48.

Once again YMMV, there are probably some 10xer devs out there capable of completing redoing their project and still making something excellent, but overall this is a recipe of failure.

However, on the flip side of this, it is recommended to pivot. This is a valuable tool in the creative process, to see that your mechanic can undergo minor alterations to make it something better. This too has a deadline but far later in the project than a complete overhaul.


## 2.4 Juice

Juice is a big part of game feel and specifically refers to the *little* things that make your game _feel_ good. Many developers skip adding juice because they don't consider it important, but you can very easily tell the difference between a submission with juice and a submission without it.

Menus, UI, instructions, sound effects, transitions, particles, etc; these are all forms of juice and they contribute to the experience of playing.

If you're looking for a way to set yourself apart from the pack then make this a focus. Even a small investment can reap large benefits when it comes to your game's overall package.

> Tip: when you finish implementing the core mechanic start looking for ways to add juice so you're not scrambling at the end to fit it in.

> Note: [here's a good article on adding Juice to your game](https://gameanalytics.com/blog/squeezing-more-juice-out-of-your-game-design.html)


## 2.5 Be mindful of the clock

Keep in mind how much time you have left. 10 hours might seem like plenty of time but remember that you need time to debug, build, and submit. Suddenly that 10 hours is looking more like 5. There's nothing worse than reaching Submission Hour and realizing that you have to download a 10GB redistributable on an unreliable WiFi connection.


## 2.6 Chill

Ludum Dare is a great experience, it's a lot of fun, and a great opportunity to hone your skills. Take a deep breath and let your project be what it's going to be.

# Part 3 - After Ludum Dare

## 3.1 Congratulate yourself

You just made a game in 48 (or 72) hours! That is amazing. Take a second to be proud of yourself and what you accomplished.

Personally, this is the reason I do Ludum Dare, every time whether it goes good or bad: if I finished I'm happy.

### If you didn't finish

Still give yourself a pat on the back. Things can get in the way of having a successful Ludum Dare weekend, sometimes your game doesn't work, sometimes submission hours sneaks up on you, and sometimes your game just doesn't come together, whatever the reason, you gave it your best shot. Take this as a learning opportunity, next time you challenge Ludum Dare you'll be more prepared.

## 3.2 Getting Noticed

Ludum Dare's sorting algorithm shows submissions based on the activity of their creator, so first of __if you want to get noticed you have to play, rate, and comment on other submissions__. Secondly, you should post your submission to forums and social media, not everyone is lurking around the Ludum Dare forums.

## 3.3 "How will I be scored"

To receive an _overall_ score you will need 20 ratings, minimum. You are scored in

## 3.3 What Else

This is the time to share that additional [content you planned earlier](#plan-your-content). Even if you didn't finish you can still share a Post Mortem, perhaps even talking about the difficulties that led to your demise.

Plus, if you're proud of your project it makes a great portfolio stuffer.

# Wrapping Up!

Ludum Dare is a fun experience, and many of us become repeat challengers. You can always use Ludum Dare as a get away from the day-to-day grind, a chance to try out something new and be creative.

If you're prepared, you just might survive.
